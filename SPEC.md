Please make me a ts cloudflare worker that I submit a query using ?q=query and it would return {activate:boolean, text:string} with text being the location. it should use the cf context to determine location but also hold the query against a list of locations to determine if that locations should not be current location but instead overwritten with the query location

be as complete as you can probably be for keywords. for cities we need an external source
