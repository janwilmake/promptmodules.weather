https://uithub.com/open-meteo/open-meteo/tree/main/docs?lines=false how can I use this api to get current weather, the coming 24 hours, and the coming week or so, for any city like I activate here? do I need api key? use no classses.

make a file weather-api.ts and then use that in the weather query so the final text to respond with markdown with tables for today and the coming week or so

@worker.ts
